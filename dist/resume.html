                    Eagle Scout is the highest achievement or rank attainable in
                    the Scouts BSA program of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).
                    Since its inception in 1911, only four percent of Scouts
                    have earned this rank after a lengthy review process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges. The
                    Eagle Scout must demonstrate Scout Spirit, an ideal attitude
                    based upon the Scout Oath and Law, service, and leadership.
                    This includes an extensive service project that the Scout
                    plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Eagle Scouts are
                    presented with a medal and a badge that visibly recognizes

                    The scholarship is intended to reduce or replace student
                    loans so that students can better focus on their academic
                    endeavors.
